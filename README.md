- **Responsive UI**: Modern admin dashboard built with React and Ant Design
- **CLI Integration**: Command-line tool for seamless integration with your development workflow

## üì¶ Components

i18n-flow consists of three main components:

1. **Admin Backend**: Go-based API server that manages all i18n data and provides RESTful endpoints
2. **Admin Frontend**: React-based dashboard for visual management of translation projects
3. **CLI Tool**: Command-line interface for developers to sync translations with their codebase

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20 or higher
- Node.js 18 or higher
- MySQL 8.0
- pnpm (preferred) or npm

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ilukemagic/i18n-flow.git
   cd i18n-flow/admin-backend
   ```

2. Configure your environment:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database credentials and other settings
   ```

3. Run the backend:

   ```bash
   go mod download
   go run main.go
   ```

4. The API will be available at `http://localhost:8080` with Swagger documentation at `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```bash
   cd ../admin-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. The admin interface will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### CLI Tool Setup

1. Install the CLI tool globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g i18n-flow-cli
   ```

2. Initialize i18n-flow in your project:

   ```bash
   i18n-flow init
   ```

3. Follow the interactive setup to configure your project with i18n-flow.

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

You can easily deploy i18n-flow using Docker and Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose v2+

### Quick Deployment

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ilukemagic/i18n-flow.git
   cd i18n-flow
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit the `.env` file to set:

   - Database credentials
   - JWT secrets
   - API keys
   - Other configuration options

3. Start the services:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   This will start three services:

   - **MySQL** database on port 3306
   - **Backend API** on port 8080
   - **Frontend admin panel** on port 80

4. Access the application:

   - Admin interface: <http://localhost>
   - API & Swagger docs: <http://localhost/swagger/index.html>

5. Initial login:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin123`
   - **Important**: Change the default password after first login!

### Docker Compose Configuration

The default `docker-compose.yml` includes:

- **Database**: MySQL 8.0 with data persistence through Docker volumes
- **Backend**: Go 1.23 API server with MySQL connection
- **Frontend**: React SPA served through Nginx with API proxying

### Custom Configuration

You can adjust the deployment by:

1. Modifying environment variables in the `.env` file
2. Changing port mappings in `docker-compose.yml`
3. Updating Docker build contexts or volumes as needed

### Updating the Application

To update to a new version:

```bash
git pull
docker compose down
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Troubleshooting

- **Database connection issues**: Check your DB credentials in the `.env` file
- **Frontend not loading**: Verify the nginx proxy configuration is correctly pointing to the backend
- **Backend not starting**: Check the backend logs with `docker compose logs backend`

## üìö Documentation

### Documentation Site

The i18n Flow documentation is available as a dedicated website:

- **URL**: When deployed via Docker, access at `http://localhost:8000/en/`
- **Languages**: Available in both English and Chinese
- **Content**:
  - Comprehensive guides for all components
  - Installation and setup instructions
  - Usage tutorials with practical examples
  - API reference documentation
  - Deployment guides

Access specific language versions:

- English: `http://localhost:8000/en/`
- Chinese: `http://localhost:8000/zh/`

### API Documentation

The API documentation is available via Swagger UI when running the backend server:

- Open `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html` in your browser

### Admin Dashboard

The admin dashboard provides an intuitive interface for:

- Managing projects and their translation keys
- Adding and updating language definitions
- Entering and editing translations
- Importing and exporting translations in various formats
- User management and access control
- Monitoring translation status and progress

### CLI Tool

The CLI tool provides the following commands:

- `init`: Initialize i18n-flow in your project
- `sync`: Sync translations from the server to your local project
- `push`: Push translation keys to the server
- `status`: Check translation status for your project

Full CLI documentation is available by running `i18n-flow --help`.

2. Define languages you need to support
3. Use the CLI to scan your source code for translation keys
4. Push new keys to the translation server with `i18n-flow push --scan`
5. Translate keys through the admin dashboard
6. Sync translations to your local project with `i18n-flow sync`
7. Update translations as needed
